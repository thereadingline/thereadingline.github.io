  about: Author of <em>Scarborough</em>
  content: "It was pure joy to read my work about Toronto's east end in Toronto's east end with this organization. The connection of cycling and books is clear to me. Both offer reflection and a fresh perspective. I read to a lively bunch of folks who cared enough about their bodies and their city to keep moving and keep reading."

  content: "The Reading Line demands you bring your mind, your body, and your bike to connect with your city. The
  Don Valley Edition brought together three fascinating places, seven great stories, and eight kilometres of
  cycling. By the end of the day I couldn&#39;t help but see Toronto differently."

  about: President of ECW Press
  content: "What a wonderful day you put together! The authors are inspiring, each one of them, talented writers and also
  people with storied lives. The locations are a revelation. I think most people who think they know the city will
  find at least one of the three locations an undiscovered gem. This year, I had never known about the Children’s
  Peace Theatre at the Massey Goulding Estate. Involving local civic leaders only solidifies the Book Ride’s
  place as a key date in the year for civic engagement. The execution from a biking standpoint is top notch. It’s
  clear that you and your team have ridden the paths several times. You have police at key places, and helpers
  the entire path, plus an on-route mechanic! Add in the way you personally connect all these elements in the
  way that you host the three events, you really do create a perfect day for books and bikes and Toronto."

  organizers ensure every detail is planned out, logistics are seamless, and the publicity push makes sure folks
  know how and when to get on board this literary love train. Good times, great reads—thanks, Reading

  about: Author of <em>Fauna</em> and <em>The Naturalist</em>
  content: "As a repeat performer with The Reading Line, I’m delighted to witness the growth of this wonderful event in
  terms of both community engagement and conceptual scope. This year’s linked themes of nature and mental
  health fit beautifully with The Reading Line’s founding friendship of books and bikes. The 2017 Don Valley
  edition made for a great day in Toronto—moving bodies and minds together through one of the city's great
  sunken treasures. I pedalled away from Corktown Common with a list of books to read, loving my city even
  more."

  about: Author of <em>All the Broken Things</em>
  content: "I loved reading from my novel <em>All the Broken Things</em> out of doors, in urban nature, in a marginal setting similar to those depicted in the story. I also loved biking from location to location, as the interlude provided the opportunity to meet people, discuss the work we had just heard, and simply move through space. The Reading Line is one of the most fun reading events ever!"

  about: Poet
  content: "The Reading Line was a nurturing experience of community that has continued to inspire me. As a poet, I was a unique part of this moving community of cycling enthusiasts thinking about books, sustainability, urban planning and food, and putting ideas into practice. The beauty of spoken word is that it synthesizes, and performing in this setting gave a grounded, big picture feeling of what we were experiencing that day."

  about: Author of <em>Yiddish for Pirates</em>
  content: "The Reading Line was a fun afternoon of book-listening and Bloor-biking and it was exhilarating to read (even in the rain) for an enthusiastic and responsive audience as they pedaled across Toronto. I was really inspired by the idea that both books and cities can be about creativity and new ways of thinking and here we were, laughing a lot and enjoying ourselves, and helping make the point that bikes are not footnotes but are an important part of the story of what moves us in the modern city."

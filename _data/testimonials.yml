  about: All the Broken Things
  content: "I loved reading from my novel All the Broken Things out of doors, in urban nature, in a marginal setting similar to those depicted in the story. I also loved biking from location to location, as the interlude provided the opportunity to meet people, discuss the work we had just heard, and simply move through space. The Reading Line is one of the most fun reading events ever!"

  about: Poet
  content: "The Reading Line was a nurturing experience of community that has continued to inspire me. As a poet, I was a unique part of this moving community of cycling enthusiasts thinking about books, sustainability, urban planning and food, and putting ideas in to practice. The beauty of spoken word is that it synthesizes, and performing in this setting gave a grounded, big picture feeling of what we were experiencing that day."

  about: I, Dr. Greenblatt, Orthodontist
  content: "The Reading Line was a fun afternoon of book-listening and Bloor-biking and it was exhilarating to read (even in the rain) for an enthusiastic and responsive audience as they pedaled across Toronto. I was really inspired by the idea that both books and cities can be about creativity and new ways of thinking and here we were, laughing a lot and enjoying ourselves, and helping make the point that bikes are not footnotes but are an important part of the story of what moves us in the modern city."

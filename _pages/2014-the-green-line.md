about:
  - title: Why here?
    img: fa-question
    body:  We hosted our inaugural Book Ride event here because we believe that The Green Line is a wonderful space in Toronto that everyone should know about. The area is currently a mixture of hydro towers, public and private amenities, green space, walkways, and gravel yards, but the Friends of the Green Line group have a great vision for the space. Park People and others are working to have the Green Line made into a continuous linear park, similar to other hydro and rail corridors that now have walkways, green spaces and playgrounds, much like the High Line in New York and the BeltLine in Atlanta.
  - title: Readings
    img: fa-book
    body: We started at the newly reopened Book City in Bloor West Village, where Catherine Bush presented her novel Accusation. Once we arrived at the Green Line, Shawn Micallef talked to the design potential of the area (Shawn was a judge of the Green Line Design competition in 2012â€“2013). Then Kathryn Kuitenbrouwer spoke about her novel, All the Broken Things, which is set in High Park. Kathryn focused on how we interpret the city through fiction. Through her writing on urban issues, Amy Lavender Harris spoke about cycling in the city. Amy also gave us a sneak peek into some of her new writings. Christina Palassio shared her thoughts on local food at a community garden just down the street from The Stop Community Food Centre at Wychwood Barns, where she works as Director of Communications. We finished with an energetic performance from spoken word artist and activist Tanya Neumeyer.
  - title: Shop Local
    img: fa-shopping-cart
    body: We wanted to connect our communities with our retailers and show that families on bicycles want to stop and shop local. The goal was to promote small businesses including Book City, Sweet Flour, Featherstone Two Wheels Green Delivery, BeerBikeTO, VERT Catering, and Coco Organic Crafted Chocolate. A big shout-out to Laurie from Featherstone Two Wheels Green Delivery, who acted as our bookmobile for the day. Laurie pulled a ton of books using pedal power and sheer determination.

about:
  - title: Politics
    img: fa-comments-o
    body: Our goal for the ride was to raise awareness of the redesigned intersection and complete streets approach at Six Points, as well as the need for bike lanes along the length of Bloor Street. Our hope was to connect the west part of Toronto with the heart of the city, along an obvious east-west corridor that is ideal for cycling.
  - title: Bloor Loves Bikes Lanes
    img: fa-heart-o
    body: Officially on the table for more than 40 years, bike lanes on Bloor are a necessary means of encouraging cyclists to ride this east–west route for commuting, shopping, and recreation. We were proud to have been just one of the actions in the long-running Bike Lanes on Bloor campaign, including Cycle Toronto’s Bloor Loves Bikes campaign. Now we have pilot bike lanes between Avenue and Shaw—hopefully just the start of physically protected bike lanes along all of Bloor and Danforth!
  - title: Shop Local
    img: fa-shopping-bag
    body: We <strong>saw</strong> the city from two wheels and <strong>heard</strong> the city from local authors as we travelled east together with a total of 8 stop & read locations along Bloor. We supported local businesses by highlighting bookstores and retailers along the route.

    body: "Within the Brick Works we will meet local photographer Robert Burley, whose new book, Enduring Wilderness, will be published by ECW Press in May 2017. Mr. Burley will share his stories about photographing this area in particular, which will be interesting for those familiar with the Don Valley and wanting to see it from a new point of view, or to those unfamiliar with the ravines or new to the city. We will seek contributing writers to this book to elaborate on this project focusing on Toronto’s ravines. Jode Roberts from the David Suzuki Foundation will then speak about the preservation of the natural landscape."

    body: "There is a new jewel in the landscape of the West Don Lands, Corktown Common, a 7.3 hectare park located at the foot of Lower River Street and Bayview Avenue. Situated on former industrial lands, the park has transformed an underutilized brownfield into a spectacular park and community meeting place featuring a lush landscape. With a marsh, sprawling lawns, urban prairies, playground areas, a splash pad and a variety of inviting features like a fireplace, permanent barbeque, large communal picnic tables and washrooms, this spectacular new greenspace is at the heart of an emerging new community. But does anyone know it’s here?"

description: We are thrilled to announce a partnership with The Festival of Literary Diversity. Together we are offering a free Book Ride in Brampton, Ontario. At the 2017 Ontario Bike Summit awards, Brampton achieved a bronze status designation, which recognizes a community that has launched several initiatives to promote a cycling culture. In recent years, the city has made investments in building a bicycle-friendly community, and championing bicycling as a safe, healthy means of recreation and transportation.

about:
  - title: 11am Brampton Library, South Fletcher's Branch
    img: fa-book
    body: We will meet at the Brampton Library at the South Fletcher’s Sportsplex. There’s an irony that a huge building designed for physical activity is surrounded by a parking lot. This part of Brampton highlights the need for safe cycling infrastructure and confirms there is more than enough room for all to share the road. Please bring your picnic blanket as our readings will be in the triangle of green grass across from the Library entrance at Ray Lawson Boulevard and McLaughlin Road South.

    body: Cycling through Brampton neighbourhoods and along the Etobicoke Creek recreational trail, you’ll realize that this winding multi-use trail requires expansion. It is priceless for a city to have a creek running through it but the access to it requires safe infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists. A large grassy area at Main Street and Peel Village Parkway in the Charles F. Watson and Family Gardens will offer us a natural respite from the city to listen to our authors. Bring a picnic blanket, water and a snack!
  - title: 2pm Garden Square

    body: Brampton’s downtown is unique and a vibrant destination. In the heart of the city, Garden Square is the site of many colourful programs and events. The Region of Peel, home to Brampton, will receive funding to help the city continue to work toward its strategic goal of improving infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians travelling along busy routes. We want to help amplify that message by gathering with our bicycles for a reading in Garden Square.

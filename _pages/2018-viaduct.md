    body: The history of Bathurst & Bloor stretches back to the 1790s, when the original boundaries of York Township were first established. In this neighbourhood you'll find A Different Booklist bookstore & event space offering book lovers literary gems from “the south to the north, from Africa to the Caribbean, from Asia to South America.” We will start our journey here.

    about: "2 to 2:30 pm we'll be found beside the steel and concrete Bloor Viaduct. Did you know it was constructed in three parts: a bridge over Rosedale Ravine, an embankment along Bloor Street and a 1,620 foot bridge over the Don Valley linking Castle Frank with Danforth Avenue. It was completed after almost four years to an official ceremony on October 18, 1918."

description: "For The Reading Line's 10th anniversary Book Ride, we are in New York City. We will ride through Lenapehoking, the ancestral homeland of the Lenape. The name Manhattan comes from their word Mannahatta, meaning island of many hills. We acknowledge the displacement of this region’s original inhabitants and the Lenape diaspora that exists today. We honor the generations of stewards, and we pay our respects to the many diverse Indigenous peoples still connected to this land."

  - title: The Route
    img: fa-road
    body: "Let's meet at the beach! GANSEVOORT PENINSULA, Hudson River Park, is lit worthy and perhaps you'll be inspired to pen a piece of poetry. We will cycle south on the Empire State Trail. Off the beaten path in SOUTH COVE, there is a place where land and water, nature and metropolis, past and present, come together. That is where you will hear JAHMAL MAYFIELD read from Smoke Kings. The propulsive novel explores decades of racial tensions through a fictional landscape where the line between justice and revenge is blurred.
    Then across the 141 year old BROOKLYN BRIDGE to Brooklyn.
    On the other side of the East River, we will go through a number of neighborhoods until we reach RED HOOK with a view of the Statue of Liberty. We will cycle up to Prospect Park finishing on Vanderbilt Avenue at a cafe. Here you will be introduced to SHENEQUA GOLDING and her blazingly honest essay collection from a refreshing new voice exploring the in-between moments for Black women and girls, and what it means to simply exist. Total route is 12 miles with plenty of stops."

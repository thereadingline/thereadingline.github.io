    body: "Let's meet in Battery Park City. Off the beaten path in South Cove, there is a place where land and water, nature and metropolis, past and present, come together. That is where you will hear Jahmal Mayfield read from his debut novel Smoke Kings. The propulsive novel explores decades of racial tensions through a fictional landscape where the line between justice and revenge is blurred.
    We will ride from Manhattan to Brooklyn.
    On the other side of the East River, you will be introduced to a blazingly honest essay collection from a refreshing new voice exploring the in-between moments for Black women and girls, and what it means to simply exist. Shenequa Golding doesnâ€™t aim to speak for all Black women. A Black Girl in the Middle is both an acknowledgment of the complexity and pride of not always fitting in and validation of what Black girlhood and womanhood can be."

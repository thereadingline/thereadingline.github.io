    body: "Word on the Street WOTS celebrates the written word and local authors over the weekend of September 27 and 28 in Toronto. I can’t think of a better time for a Book Ride nor a more perfect book than At Last Count by debut author Claire Ross Dunn."
  - title: MeetUp
    img: fa-road
    body: "I’ve always wanted to produce a ride to locations where a writer wrote their book and/or to the significant spots in the novel. Unlike previous Book Rides where we’ve had an author speak a little and then give a reading in one location, this Book Ride will truly be a moving book club meeting with Claire."
  - title: The Route
    img: fa-pagelines
    body: "The bicycle tour will be a slow roll, approximately 8km, to eight spots in Toronto beginning in the east end on the Danforth through some leafy neighbourhoods north of Rosedale Valley Road and then south through University of Toronto and finishing at Another Story Bookshop’s booth at WOTS in David Pecaut Square. Books will be available to purchase and of course Claire would be happy to sign your copy!"

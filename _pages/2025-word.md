description: "Word on the Street WOTS celebrates the written word and local authors over the weekend of September 27 and 28 in Toronto. I can’t think of a better time for a Book Ride nor a more perfect book than At Last Count by debut author Claire Ross Dunn."

about:
  - title: The Novel
    img: fa-book
    body: "At Last Count is a romantic coming-of-age tale for adult readers about a Toronto birding archivist who is losing her apartment to condos – particularly challenging because she struggles with OCD and being displaced is a trigger. She discovers the only person who can help reclaim her family home in rural Ontario is her childhood nemesis. Told in two time periods as their past relationship dovetails with the present. The novel is a captivating page turner with themes of mental health, personal growth, and the power of confronting one’s past written with the power to make us laugh and cry in the same breath."
  - title: The Route
    img: fa-road
    body: "The bicycle tour will be a slow roll, approximately 8km, to eight spots in Toronto beginning in the east end on the Danforth through some leafy neighbourhoods north of Rosedale Valley Road and then south through University of Toronto and finishing at Another Story Bookshop’s booth at WOTS in David Pecaut Square. Books will be available to purchase and of course Claire would be happy to sign your copy!"
  - title: The Meetup

    body: "I’ve always wanted to produce a ride to locations where a writer wrote their book and/or to the significant spots in the novel. Unlike previous Book Rides where we’ve had an author speak a little and then give a reading in one location, this Book Ride will truly be a moving book club meeting with Claire."

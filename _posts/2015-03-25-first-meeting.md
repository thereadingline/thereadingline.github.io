The Reading Line crew met at The Black Canary Espresso Bar on Sherbourne Street in Toronto last week for our first meeting of 2015. Welcome to our new volunteers, who bring a ton of experience: Kate, Cassie, Maureen, and Ana Laura. The #BooksOnBloor ride is set for May 30th, 2015, and we have our work cut out for us! Making Toronto a better city, one street and one book at a time, will require many cups of tea, coffee, and Nutella lattes. Feeling grateful and excited for our #bookride!

The invitations are rolling out!

First up ... Doug Saunders!

Doug Saunders is the former European Bureau Chief of the Globe and Mail and the author of Arrival City: The Final Migration and Our Next World, which won the Donner Prize, and which the Guardian said “may be the best popular book on cities since Jane Jacobs’s The Death and Life of Great American Cities half a century ago.” He is also the author of The Myth of the Muslim Tide and has won four National Newspaper Awards. Saunders lives in Toronto. [Check out his website](http://dougsaunders.net)

Doug Saunders will be one of our speakers at Six Points intersection (between 11 am and noon), on the need for urban planning. Please see the schedule for the full list of speakers.

Following Doug Saunders will be ... Ken Greenberg!

Ken Greenberg is an architect and urban designer, living in Toronto. For over three decades he has played a pivotal role on public and private assignments in urban settings throughout North America and Europe, focusing on the rejuvenation of downtowns, waterfronts, neighbourhoods and university campuses from the scale of the city region to that of the city block. Cities as diverse as Toronto, Hartford, Amsterdam, New York, Boston, Montréal, Washington, DC, Paris, Detroit, Saint Paul and San Juan, Puerto Rico, have benefited from his advocacy and passion for restoring the vitality, relevance and sustainability of the public realm in urban life. A former Director of Urban Design and Architecture for the City of Toronto and Principal of Greenberg Consultants, he is the recipient of the 2010 American Institute of Architects Thomas Jefferson Award for public design excellence. He is also the author of Walking Home: The Life and Lessons of a City Builder, which was a national bestseller.

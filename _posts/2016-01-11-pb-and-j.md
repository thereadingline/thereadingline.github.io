We’ve found we work best when in the same room: no email, no phone tag, just an hour of conversation. Since we work in the same building, we can slip into a meeting room for an hour or so every few weeks and chat all things book ride. Our meeting rooms are named after major figures in Canadian Literature, naturally.

This week in one of our face-to-face meetings (in the Robertson Davies room, if you’re keeping track) we came up with the focus of this year’s book ride along Bathurst Street in Toronto: Jane Jacobs and June Callwood. #BooksOnBathurst will honour these two extraordinary women and their writing.

This year would have been Jane Jacobs’s 100th birth year, and there are tons of celebrations planned in her honour. We love that we can apply Jane’s “sidewalk ballet” and other thoughts on the cityscape to our book ride…after all, the whole point of The Reading Line is to make our city a better place, one street and one book at a time.

June Callwood believed in kindness above all, and loved children. A park named in her honour recently opened near the lake, and we’ll be wrapping up our ride there with performances by local authors and a family-friendly event. Stay tuned for full programming!

Jane and June…it really couldn’t be a better combo.

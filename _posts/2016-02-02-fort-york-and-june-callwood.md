Yesterday Janet Joy and I stole away on our bikes during our lunch break. It was a sublimely sunny day, and we rode against the wind from our office at Front and Spadina to Fort York Library at Bathurst, south of Front.

If you haven’t been to Fort York Library, please make it a destination! The library will be celebrating its second anniversary on May 29, the day after #BooksOnBathurst.

What a treat to meet Ted Belke! Ted is the branch head at the Fort York Library, and he showed us around this beautiful space.

The library’s architecture acknowledges the former uses of the site, and the graduated tile floor is meant to emulate the shoreline of Lake Ontario. Poetry by Margaret Atwood encircles the library, and Charles Pachter‘s art is hung inside. It’s a stunning location, and where we’ll kick off our #bookride on May 28.

Then we headed slightly south and west to June Callwood Park. So very PINK! June Callwood is one of my personal heroes…I admire her writing and activism, and her belief in kindness above all. This park is part urban forest, part sound installation, with plenty of places for children to play. It is a visually and physically mapped voiceprint of June’s quote “I believe in kindness,” which she said during her last interview before her death in 2007. I loved exploring the geometric nooks and crannies of this park, and standing in the soundfield, listening to the clouds pass overhead.

June Callwood Park will be our final destination on #BooksOnBathurst on May 28. Stay tuned for full programming, coming soon!
